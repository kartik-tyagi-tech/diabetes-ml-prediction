# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning (Model Comparison)

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on predicting whether a person is diabetic or non-diabetic using multiple machine learning classification algorithms.

Instead of relying on a single model, different supervised learning models are trained and evaluated to compare their performance and determine the most effective approach.
